# Health Quest: A Voyage To Happieness

Welcome to **Health Quest: A Voyage To Happieness**, an exciting 2D platformer that takes you on an adventure to allow you to gain new healthy habits and educate yourself on different topics such as food, smoking and exercise. 
You will collect healthy/non-healthy items as well as power ups to help you get through 10 different levels, along with quizzes but be warned as all levels must be completed within the time limit.

### Gameplay
1. **Capture the flag:** Your primary objective is to get to the flag while collecting as much fruit and power ups as you can.
